-> # Code Review

## Agenda

- Pull request with code review and CI
- Author's perspective
- Reviewer's perspective
- Discussion

---

# What's a pull request?

> Pull requests let you _tell others about changes_
> you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub.
> Once a pull request is opened, you can **discuss** and
> **review** the potential changes with collaborators
> and **add follow-up commits** before your changes
> are merged into the base branch.

# Why code reviews?

## Goal

- Goal: Improve the quality of the code that's added
- Systematic approach to reviewing other programmers' code for mistakes
- Checks if all _requirements_ have been implemented correctly

---

# Why code reviews?

## Share knowledge

> Code review is **more than just a quality check**

Multiple developers looking at the PR:

- They are exposed to new code
- Reviewers _have to understand_ the context and scope
- Can be a great tool to reduce technical debt

---

# Why code reviews?

## Get feedback

Can be a valuable learning moment for developers
=> Get _feedback_ about your code and coding style

---

# Pull Request and Code Review

- In general: Pull request setup and CI
- Author: How to _create_ a pull request?
- Reviewer: How to _review_ a pull request?

---

# Pull Request: Setup

Opinionated, whatever works _best for the team_

- Team: Decide how comments should be handled.
- Define number of approvals and when
- Decide how developers are assigned

---

# Pull Request: CI (Continuous Integration)

> Automate everything that's possible

- Tests
- Code Coverage
- Deployment
- Formatting
- Static code analysis
- Special rules the team has decided on
  e.g. line length, forbidden imports or words

---

# Author: How to create a pull request?

How to open a pull request that can easily be reviewed?

---

# Create a pull request

## Provide information

> What would you tell somebody?

- "No description provided"?!
- "WIP" or "Make linter happy"?!

---

# Create a pull request

## Share insights

> What would you tell somebody?

Don't explain what is clear already,
but explain what is **interesting to others**.

- What were the decisions and why?
- Are you uncertain about some decisions?

---

# Create a pull request

## Provide information

Screenshots or video
Smaller change is easier to review
Speak about controversial questions before code review
Commits (and commit messages) can be powerful

---

# Create a pull request

## Share knowledge

Also leverage other formats:

- Call to discuss a topic in detail
- Small presentation

---

# Create a pull request

## Self-Review

Review your own pull request
... and this time it's **fine if you're nitpicky**

---

# Reviewer: How to review a pull request?

How to give valuable feedback?

---

# Code Review: Try the code

Try to **run** the code
Try to **understand**
Try to **break it** (QA)!

---

# Code Review: Friendly atmosphere

Specific and actionable feedback
Serves the team, is not about letting pass
Clear, over communicate. What to do? Or "you decide".
Language is important, be nice to each other. (TODO: Friendly atmosphere)
Comments should be about the code (Not: I don't like this).
Language is important, since it might look negative.
Do not trust, ask questions instead
PR in PR? Or suggestions?
Check your comments again
Discussions: But keep small

---

# Code Review: Try the code

Try the code
Try to understand
QA! Developers should always do QA. Break it.

Tests: Were tests added? Do the tests make sense coverage?

Relation: How important is the code?
Is it a small improvement or a large feature that could break everything?

Hard: Consistency, naming, modules/folders
Beware of "bikeshedding"
Is the change an opinion and could the author just have a different opinion

---

# Code Review 3: Questions

- How important is the code that is changed?
- Do I understand the change?
- Is there a simpler way to achieve the same goal?
- Could the change break something or other teams?
- What are the edge cases?
- Could this introduce security issue?
- Are tests added?

---

# Code Review: Discussion

What is working well?
